## Learning Python

Python, as a scripting language, is quite unknown to me. This directory focuses on my process of learning Python.

### Programs within this folder:
First, my focus is on learning the syntax of the basic principles of the language. "hello_world.py" shows a basic Hello World program that uses for loops, increments, "error handling" (very basic), and functions. 

Next, I worked on a basic palindrome checker. It does the basic palindrome checker things (if word == word[::-1]) and you can check multiple palindromes with a for loop. This should lead to more advanced programs that used a text-based GUI and file reading.
